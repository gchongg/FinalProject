<h3> What have you done so far?  </h3>
Ã¥
<p>We are working with the CAPEs dataset. We have taken the necessary steps to clean the data and performed exploratory data analysis to identify both obvious and non-obvious trends that we believe are important to include in our explorable explanation. To provide more specific insights into the trends, we have filtered the dataset to only include Data Science courses. Our first interactive visualization compares weekly study hours to average grades received and includes a hover option for course details. We are currently working on enhancing the visualization frame with filter boxes for selected courses and axis choices.</p> 

<h3> What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why? </h3>

<p> We believe that the most challenging task of our project is implementing the scrolling mechanism to ensure a smooth transition between different sections. Specifically, we need to connect the specific functions per visualization to avoid any overlap. 
  We will have annotations, labels, and interactive features for each visualization, but we want to make sure that our page layout doesn't cut off any important information or become too overwhelming for our audience. We're currently figuring out the best way to present everything (order of trends, and plot types for specific sections) so that our project can be delivered effectively. </p>
